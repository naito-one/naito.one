    <h2>Energy signature</h2>

    <p>
      If you have a temperature sensor as well as a sensor on a heating resource
      for a building (like electricity, gas or oil), an energy signature tool is
      made available to you.<br />
      This tool allows you to identify irregularities in heating in order to
      optimize your facilities and save money.
    </p>

      Is it hard to give yourself energy consumption objectives? Thanks to

      You want to be alerted when the temperature of a premise gets abnormally
      high or low?
